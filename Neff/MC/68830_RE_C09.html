In the following example, would this be true? A gallon of gasoline releases about 9 Kg CO2 when burned. If it takes about 2 Kg of coal to produce the electricity to make one gallon of biofuel and each Kg of coal results in the emission of 3.75 Kg CO2, how much would CO2 emissions be reduced or increased by using biofuel instead of gasoline? You can assume that a gallon of biofuel and a gallon of gasoline have exactly the same amount of energy in them.",
