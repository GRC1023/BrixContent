              "question": "One of the major concerns about current first generation biomass fuels is that they take a lot of energy to produce and therefore wonâ€™t help to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. In the following example, would this be true? A gallon of gasoline releases about 9 kg CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e when burned. If it takes about 2 kg of coal to produce the electricity to make one gallon of biofuel and each kilogram of coal results in the emission of 3.75 kg CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e, how much would CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e emissions be reduced or increased by using biofuel instead of gasoline? You can assume that a gallon of biofuel and a gallon of gasoline have exactly the same amount of energy in them.",
