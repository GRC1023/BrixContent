Their respective oil production and oil consumption rates for 2012 are also displayed in the table. Using the data from the table and the equation you created on the previous page, estimate how many years of production of oil the United States has left at current production rates. [Hint: Remember, estimated time that reserves will remain equals reserves divided by production.]",
