In other words, if the United States didnâ€™t import oil from elsewhere and could extract as much as it wanted each year, how long could it sustain its own demand on domestic supplies? To estimate this, use a similar equation to the one you created earlier, but replace production with consumption. [Hint: Remember, estimated time that reserves will remain equals reserves divided by production.]",
