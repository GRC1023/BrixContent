Your friend is skeptical; he argues that wind farms kill birds, solar facilities interrupt animal migrations and habitats, and hydropower ruins river habitats—how could all of that possibly be environmentally friendly?  Which of the following arguments could you respond with to demonstrate some of the positive benefits you were thinking of and that might balance the points that your friend mentioned.",
