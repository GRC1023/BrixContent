The president’s legislative program proposed in 1948 included some of these measures, notably the establishment of a permanent FEPC and a civil rights commission. But southern resistance blocked action by Congress, and the inclusion of a strong civil rights plank in the 1948 Democratic platform led to the walkout of southern delegations and a separate States’ Rights (Dixiecrat) ticket that fall. African American voters in the North overwhelmingly backed Truman over Dewey in 1948. The African American vote in Los Angeles, Cleveland, and Chicago ensured the Democratic victory in California, Ohio, and Illinois. Truman responded by including civil rights legislation in his Fair Deal program in 1949. Again, however, southerners blocked congressional action on both a permanent FEPC and an anti-lynching measure."
