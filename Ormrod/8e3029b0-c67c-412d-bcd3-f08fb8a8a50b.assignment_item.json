An in-depth lesson might be a good way to help students master the concept in and of itself, but to promote retrieval over the long run, the lesson would need to help students connect inertia to numerous other things in long-term memory—something this lesson isn’t necessarily doing. Furthermore, students should revisit the concept of inertia in additional lessons over time, providing the review that will enhance the likelihood of later retrieval."
