They often do not consider that the length of the hypotenuse is always greater than the length of each side of the triangle. As a result, they use the formula incorrectly by squaring and adding the one side to the square of hypotenuse to find the value of the third side. Instead, they should subtract the square of the side from the square of the hypotenuse. Which one of the following instructional strategies is most likely to help them undergo conceptual change regarding this topic?\u003c/span\u003e",
