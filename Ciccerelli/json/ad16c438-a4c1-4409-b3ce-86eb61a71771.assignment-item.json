At first Kayla was asked to watch from across the room as the therapist showed her how to approach and pet the dog and not grab its tail. Eventually, Kayla was asked to come over and mimic the behavior she had observed. After just a few sessions, Kayla was no longer fearful of dogs. What technique did the therapist use with Kayla?\n\u003cbr /\u003e",
