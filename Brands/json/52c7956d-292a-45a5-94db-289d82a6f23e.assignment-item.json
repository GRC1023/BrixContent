He visits a local bookstore, buys a few paperbacks, and heads to the checkout line. When the clerk asks if he found everything he was looking for, Tim replies in all seriousness that his watch has been missing for several days, and he thinks that he left it in a friend’s car. He asks the clerk to help him find the watch. He then observes the clerk’s response. How is the clerk likely to react to Tim’s behavior?\n\u003cbr /\u003e",
