After the fighting started at Fort Sumter, he expanded the regular army and advanced public money to private individuals without congressional authorization. On April 27, 1861, he declared martial law, which enabled the military to arrest civilians suspected of aiding the enemy, and suspended the writ of habeas corpus in the area between Philadelphia and Washington, because of mob attacks on Union troops in Baltimore. Jefferson Davis, most historians agree, was a less effective war leader. He defined his powers as commander in chief narrowly and literally, which meant he personally directed the armed forces but left policymaking for mobilizing and controlling the civilian population primarily to the Confederate Congress."
