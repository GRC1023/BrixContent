Four African American students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College sat down at a lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, and refused to move after being denied service. Other students, whites and blacks, joined in similar “sit-ins” across the South. By 1961, 50,000 young people had desegregated public facilities in more than 100 southern cities. The movement led to the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in April 1960.
